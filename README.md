**Warning**: This project is still **WIP**, and many features **will** change in future.

This is one of my crazy ideas, and it is debugging the **PROS** code by using a **Raspberry Pi** hooked up to it and running a server there.

I will write a tutorial on this soon, when I will have enough time and will get this working.
